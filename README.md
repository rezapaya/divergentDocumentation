======================

Documentation for Divergent Media Applications. Take a look at our doc workflow, or submit a fix.

For a bit more information on our documentation workflow, take a look at our [behind the scenes](http://www.divergentmedia.com/blog/fullpost/manualworkflow) post.  

This repository doesn't include the fonts referenced in the LaTeX templates, so you may get warnings if you try to use these templates as is.  We recommend customizing them for your own uses.

The "install notes" file includes the necessary commands for getting your Mac ready to build the manuals.  Just run "./buildScript.sh <appname>" to compile a PDF and HTML version from the Markdown source.  The output will be placed in the "output" folder.
